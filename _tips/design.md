The Claude model in GitHub Copilot is particularly good at design. If you give it a few parameters and some inspiration, it can generate pretty remarkable layouts. It's perfect for those of us that love design but are not designers. A good workflow is to use a mockup file with Copilot Edits to get the design right, and then ask Edits to apply the mockup.
