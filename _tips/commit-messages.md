Copilot can generate commit messages for you based on the staged changes. This can be done either from the source control view or the terminal. Copilot looks at your last 10 commit messages to try and follow any format or conventions that you already have. You can get full control the format of these messages with [Custom Instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_define-commit-message-generation-custom-instructions).
