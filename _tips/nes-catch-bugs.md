GitHub Copilot's [Next Edit Suggestions](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_97#_copilot-next-edit-suggestions-preview) will find bugs in your code just by you being in the file. Even if you are working on something completely unrelated. This often means finding bugs you don't even know exist.
